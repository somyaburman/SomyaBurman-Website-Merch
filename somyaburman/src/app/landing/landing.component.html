              Hi, I am <b>Somya Burman</b>. A software engineer by graduation and an artist by passion.
              Since childhood I was always inclined towards art but my passion for it increased during my engineering days. It has been 
              nearly 6 years that I am practicing art constantly and over these years I have explored multiple styles and mediums.
              From mandalas to watercolours to digital painting, I have never restricted myself from trying out any sort of art style and this is what has helped me grow in numerous ways.
              I hereby present to you the best of my products. I do take commissioned work as well. Please feel free to contact and 
              drop in your requests and suggestions.
              Have a wonderful day!
